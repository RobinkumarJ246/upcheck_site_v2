          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            One day, we happened to meet the father of a mutual neighborhood friend, a hardworking shrimp farmer from a small town near ours. What began as casual small talk soon turned into something deeper as he opened up about the struggles he faced every day. <br /><br />
            His words stayed with us long after the conversation ended. That evening, as we discussed what we had heard, we couldn't shake off a feeling, we had to do something. Shrimp farming shouldn't be this hard. Farmers like him deserved better tools, better support, and a way to make their hard work pay off. <br /><br />
            That's how UpCheck was born. We started with one clear goal: to help shrimp farmers like him take control of their ponds and their future. From that one conversation, weâ€™ve come a long way. But our purpose remains the same: to bring hope, support, and change to the hardworking farmers who are the backbone of aquaculture.
